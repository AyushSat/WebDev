    <h1 class="title">Frequent Flyer Information</h1>
    <p> Here at CAirlines, we value your loyalty. Our Frequent Flyer Program reflects this, so opposed to other airlines,
	we offer miles that stick with you for life, instead of disappearing after one year. 
	We've sorted our flyers into different tiers,
	but compared to other airlines, we trust that you will stick with our amazing service, so our mile requirements are much lower than 
	regular airlines. Our four tiers are:
	 - Silver: Earned by customers with more than 25,000 miles.
	 - Gold: Earned by customers with more than 40,000 miles.
	 - Platinum: Earned by customers with more than 75,000 miles.
	 - Premiere: Earned by customers with more than 100,00 miles.
	 
	 At CAirlines, no matter what tier you are placed in, numerous benefits await you, both in and out of the aircraft.
	 The benefits offered are as follows:
	 - Silver: Free, unlimited non-alcoholic drinks and snacks offered during flight and before boarding.
	 - Gold: Silver's perks, with alcoholic drinks offered during flight and before boarding, earlier boarding than Silver.
	 - Platinum: Front seating offered, more leg space, earlier boarding than Gold.
	 - Premiere: Free upgrades to upper class seating if available, no flight change fee.
