                Here at CAirlines, we value your loyalty. Our Frequent Flyer Program reflects this, so opposed to other airlines,
        we offer miles that stick with you for life, instead of disappearing after one year. We've sorted our flyers into different tiers,
        but compared to other airlines, we trust that you will stick with our amazing service, so our mile requirements are much lower than 
        regular airlines. At CAirlines, no matter what tier you are placed in, numerous benefits await you, both in and out of the aircraft. Our tiers and their
        respective benefits are as follows:
